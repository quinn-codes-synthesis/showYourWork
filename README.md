effective 1/24/19: now includes completed problem sets from Harvard's CS50

effective 10/18/18: now includes code solutions from Codecademy

I've been self-teaching via FreeCodeCamp, and I end up referencing prior FCC challenges a lot when working on projects and while muddling through more complex challenges. However, FCC doesn't appear to save your solutions in such a way that you can access it across different devices. Because sticking to one device isn't practical for me, I thought it best to start collecting my solutions off-site. I'm also taking notes on paper, to supplement all this.

Other FCC users may feel free to reference this if it helps them, just keep in mind FCC's Academic Honesty Policy. :)
