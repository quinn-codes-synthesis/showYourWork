# showYourWork
FreeCodeCamp hasn't been saving the code I write when completing their challenges. I wanted to store my solutions somewhere for my own future reference (i.e. while working on larger projects).<br>
<br>
At the time of this repo's initialization, I've completed 100% of the Responsive Web Design(RWD) challenges and about 85% of the "Basic Javascript" section of the Java Algorithms and Data Structures challenges. But given that I end up referencing prior challenges a lot when working on my RWD projects and while muddling through more complex javascript challenges, I thought it best to start collecting my solutions in one place... and I might actually start the challenges over from the beginning so I can save solutions as I go. I'm also taking notes on paper, to supplement all this.<br>

Other FCC users may feel free to reference this if it helps them, but do keep in mind FCC's Academic Honesty Policy! :)<br>
